Time Series Energy Demand: Prediction using XGBoost
EDA is finished. The next step is modeling.

Modeling Phase: Energy Demand Prediction using XGBoost

    1. Data Preparation: Prepare the dataset for modeling by ensuring it is in the correct format and splitting it into training and testing sets.

    2. Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that may improve the model's performance, such as lag features, rolling averages, or additional time-based features.

    3. Model Selection: Choose the XGBoost algorithm for its robustness and efficiency in handling time series prediction.

    4. Model Training: Train the XGBoost model on the training dataset, tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

    5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, or MAPE.

    6. Model Validation: Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability and to avoid overfitting.

    7. Forecasting: Use the trained model to make future energy demand predictions.

    8. Result Analysis: Analyze the predictions, compare them with actual values, and interpret the results to gain insights.

    9. Deployment: Deploy the model for real-time prediction if needed, setting up necessary pipelines for continuous forecasting.

    10. Documentation: Document the entire modeling process, including assumptions, methods, and findings, to ensure reproducibility and clarity.
